"""
Batch 14 — Monthly payroll pipeline test (synthetic, idempotent).

Verifies:
  1. compute_run creates draft + items
  2. compute_run idempotent (same period → already_exists)
  3. State machine: submit → approve → lock → paid (with idempotency key set)
  4. Disallowed transitions rejected
  5. cancel_run from draft works on a 2nd employee
  6. list_runs filters by status
  7. Approval log entries written for each transition

Cleans up its own rows.
