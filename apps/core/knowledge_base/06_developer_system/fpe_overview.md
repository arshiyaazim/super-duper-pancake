## Visibility and AI Exposure Rules

| Content | Visibility | AI May Expose? |
|---|---|---|
| FPE exists and processes payments | Admin | Admin only — confirm to admin |
| Worker names, count, intervals | Developer | No — developer only |
| Transaction amounts or ledger entries | Restricted | Never |
| Employee payment history | Restricted | Never |
| `fpe_employees` or `fpe_cash_transactions` table existence | Developer | Never expose table names |
| API routes (`/api/fpe/...`) | Developer | Never expose to candidates/employees |
| Zero-loss unmatched queue | Admin | Summarize count to admin; no details |
| FPE vs core payroll distinction | Developer | Never |

## Purpose

The Fazle Payroll Engine (FPE) is the financial processing subsystem of the platform. It ingests WhatsApp messages from the accountant-owner conversation, parses payment records (bKash, Nagad, cash, escort duty payments), matches them to employees, and writes verified transactions to an immutable accounting ledger.

Source-of-truth distinction: employee-origin payment/advance requests never create ledger transactions. They create `fazle_payment_drafts`. Final ledger transactions come from Admin -> Accountant payment instructions, or from explicitly promoted/reviewed rows.

FPE is distinct from the core payroll module (`modules/payroll`). The core payroll module manages the employee salary cycle (draft → reviewed → approved → locked → paid). FPE ingests raw message data to build the underlying transaction record that the salary cycle operates on.

**FPE answers the question:** "What was actually paid to whom, when, and via what method?"
**Core payroll answers the question:** "Has this payroll run been reviewed and approved by management?"

---

## Scope

FPE handles:
- Parsing payment messages from the accountant-owner WhatsApp conversation
- Employee matching and auto-creation
- Immutable transaction ledger maintenance
- Historical backfill from bridge SQLite stores
- Review queue for unmatched or ambiguous payments
- Admin API for transaction review, reversal, and reconciliation

FPE does NOT handle:
- The main salary cycle (draft/review/approve states) — that is `modules/payroll`
- Employee attendance — that is `modules/attendance`
- Escort program state management — that is `modules/escort_lifecycle`
- WhatsApp message routing for employees/admins — that is `app/message_router`

## Startup Lifecycle

**Entry point:** `modules/fazle_payroll_engine/__init__.py`

1. `start_fpe(chat_jids)` is called from `app/main.py` lifespan on startup.
2. All 9 migration files (`migrations/001_fpe_schema.sql` → `009_stabilization.sql`) are run in alphabetical order using idempotent SQL (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
3. Schema is ready after migrations complete.
4. Five background asyncio tasks are started via `start_workers()`.

**Shutdown:** `stop_fpe()` cancels all 5 workers gracefully on `fazle-core.service` stop.

**Migration policy:** Add `NNN_description.sql`. Never DROP columns. Never rename columns. Restart service to apply.

---

## The 5 Workers

### Worker 1 — message_processor_worker (`fpe_msg_processor`)

**Status:** ACTIVE — core pipeline worker
**Poll interval:** 3 seconds
**Batch size:** 20 messages per tick

**What it does:**
1. Polls `fpe_message_processing_state` for rows with `status = 'pending'`.
2. Marks the row as `parsing`.
3. Calls `parse_message(content, msg_date)` to classify and extract payment data.
4. If parser confidence < 0.7 AND message has content: calls `ai_enhance_parse()` (Ollama) to recover the parse.
5. Determines next status based on `message_type`:
   - `payment` or `escort_payment` → `parsed` (proceeds to accounting_worker)
   - `cash_command` or `income_command` → checks sender authorization → `parsed` if authorized, `skipped` if not
   - All others (balance_summary, other) → `skipped`; logged to `fpe_unmatched_messages` for admin review
6. Non-payment messages from non-owner senders (`is_from_me=False`, type=`other`) → `skipped` immediately.

**Authorization check for commands:**
- `cash_command`: sender phone must be in `settings.fpe_cash_authorized_phone_list`
- `income_command`: sender phone must be in `settings.fpe_income_authorized_phone_list`
- Unauthorized senders → `skipped` silently (no error reply)

---

### Worker 2 — accounting_worker (`fpe_accounting`)

**Status:** ACTIVE — creates the immutable ledger
**Poll interval:** 5 seconds (3s base + 2s offset from parser)
**Batch size:** 20 messages per tick

**What it does:**
1. Polls for `fpe_message_processing_state` rows with `status = 'parsed'`.
2. Joins `fpe_parser_results` to get parsed data.
3. Calls `validate_for_accounting(msg_type, pdata)` — type-aware validation (see `validation.py MESSAGE_RULES`).
4. On validation failure → stores to `fpe_unmatched_messages`, marks `skipped`.

**Per message_type behavior:**

| Message Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `payment` | Requires admin/accountant final-instruction context or manual promotion. Calls `match_or_create_employee()`. Creates transaction only after final instruction/review is satisfied. |
| `escort_payment` | Parses multi-employee list (NAME=AMOUNT/ per line). Creates one `fazle_payment_drafts` row per entry. Links to escort program if duty_date matches. |
| `cash_command` | Employee MUST already exist in `fpe_employees` (no auto-create). If not found: sends WhatsApp error reply to the source chat JID. Creates salary transaction. |
| `income_command` | Auto-creates employee if not found. Creates income transaction via `create_income_transaction()`. |

**Zero-loss invariant:** If money is detected but cannot be matched to an employee, the detected data (amount, phone, name, method, date, confidence) is stored in `fpe_unmatched_messages`. The ledger is NEVER touched. An admin must promote the unmatched row to a verified transaction.

**No auto-finalize from employee request:** Generic bKash/Nagad SMS, employee requests, voice+number requests, or ambiguous money text stay in staging/review/draft. They do not directly write `fpe_cash_transactions` or `wbom_cash_transactions`.

**Prometheus gauges updated on each tick:**
- `fpe_pending_review_count` — rows in `fpe_unmatched_messages` with `review_status='pending'`
- `fpe_dlq_count` — messages with `status='failed'` and `attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS (5)`

---

### Worker 3 — historical_sync_loop (`fpe_hsync`)

**Status:** ACTIVE — required for financial completeness
**Poll interval:** `FPE_HSYNC_INTERVAL_S` env (default 15 seconds)
**Batch size:** 200 messages per SQLite fetch

**What it does:**
- Reads bridge SQLite stores directly from disk (NOT the WhatsApp API):
  - Bridge1: `/home/azim/whatsapp1/store/messages.db`
  - Bridge2: `/home/azim/whatsapp2/store/messages.db`
- Loads LID resolution map from `whatsapp.db` (LID → phone number)
- Processes ALL messages from the target chat JIDs (both `is_from_me=True` and `is_from_me=False`)
- Advances by `last_timestamp` per checkpoint stored in `fpe_sync_checkpoints`
- Does NOT send any replies — pure read/ingest into `fpe_wa_messages`

**Target JIDs:** Configured via `FPE_SYNC_CHAT_JIDS` env. Default includes owner→accountant conversation JID for Bridge2 (8801880446111 → accountant).

**`BRIDGE1_INGEST_ALL_DMS=true`:** Enumerates ALL individual DM chat JIDs from Bridge1 SQLite instead of only the configured JIDs.

**Purpose:** Provides financial completeness. The main bridge poller only sees live messages. Historical sync recovers all payment messages from before FPE was installed, and fills any gaps during bridge downtime.

---

### Worker 4 — gap_scan_loop (`fpe_gapscan`)

**Status:** ACTIVE — safety net for missed messages
**Poll interval:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
**Limit:** 5,000 IDs compared per chat per pass

**What it does:**
- Computes ID-based diff: `set(SQLite message IDs for chat JID) - set(fpe_wa_messages.wa_message_id for that source + JID)`
- Ingests any IDs found in SQLite but missing from FPE via the standard `ingest_message()` pipeline
- Catches messages that `historical_sync_loop` missed due to out-of-order timestamps, clock skew, or replay from WhatsApp servers

**Why this exists:** `historical_sync_loop` advances by timestamp. A message written to SQLite out of timestamp order (e.g., WhatsApp server replay) is invisible to the timestamp-based advance. `gap_scan_loop` uses IDs (which are monotonic) as the diff key instead.

---

### Worker 5 — bridge_health_loop (`fpe_bridge_health`)

**Status:** ACTIVE — monitoring and alerting
**Poll interval:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)

**What it does:**
- Checks bridge ingestion gaps: no new messages in last 30 minutes → `_GAP_ALERT_MINS` threshold → WARNING log
- Checks skip ratio: >20% of messages skipped in last 1 hour → `_SKIP_RATIO_WARN` threshold → WARNING log
- Checks retry storm: >10 messages with `attempts > 2` → `_RETRY_STORM_THRESH` threshold → WARNING log
- Checks DLQ depth: >20 messages in DLQ → `_DLQ_WARN_THRESH` threshold → WARNING log
- Publishes Prometheus gauges via `modules.observability`

**This worker is observability-only.** It does not ingest, parse, or modify any data. Safe to disable (`SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` does not affect this worker — it is an asyncio task, not a scheduled job).

---

            (DLQ state — remains failed, surfaced via /api/fpe/admin/dlq)
```

**State transitions are tracked in `fpe_message_processing_state`.**
Each status change also increments `attempts`.

## Message Types and Parser

**Source:** `modules/fazle_payroll_engine/parser.py`

| MessageType | Format Example | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `payment` | "Al Momin 01712345678(N) 5000/-" | employee_name_raw, payout_phone, payout_method, amount, txn_date |
| `balance_summary` | "জমা: 45000/-, বাকি: 12000/-" | summary_date, total_due, total_collected |
| `cash_command` | "Cash 01712345678 Al Momin 5000" | payout_phone, employee_name_raw, amount |
| `income_command` | "Income 01712345678 Al Momin 5000" | payout_phone, employee_name_raw, amount |
| `escort_payment` | "Al Momin=5000/\nRashid=4500/" | entries (name_raw, amount), shift, duty_date |
| `other` | (anything else) | None |

**Payout methods parsed:** bkash, nagad, cash, rocket, bank, unknown

**AI enhancement:** If `confidence < 0.7` and message has content, Ollama is called with the raw text. The AI response is converted to a `ParseResult` only if `is_payment=True` in the JSON response. AI enhancement is logged as `ai_enhanced=True` in `fpe_parser_results`.

---

## Employee Identity in FPE

FPE maintains its own employee table (`fpe_employees`) that is **separate from the main `wbom_employees` table**.

**Why separate:** FPE reconstructs employee identity from historical WhatsApp message text, not from the HR system. Employee records are auto-created from parsed payment messages and merged over time.

**Employee matching hierarchy (from `employee.match_or_create_employee()`):**

1. Exact `employee_id_phone` match
2. Exact `primary_phone` match
3. Alias phone match (`fpe_employee_aliases`)
4. Exact normalized name match
5. Alias name match
6. Fuzzy name match (rapidfuzz, threshold 90%)
7. Auto-create if nothing found (for payment and income_command types)

**Soft-merge (canonical resolution):**
Duplicate employee rows are folded via `canonical_employee_id`. All transactions from merged rows are reported under the canonical employee. The duplicate row is preserved (never deleted). Transaction history is immutable regardless of merge.

**`fpe_employee_aliases` table:** Stores alternative phones, names, and employee ID numbers per employee. An alias can only belong to one employee (UNIQUE constraint on alias_type + alias_value).

---

## Database Tables

All FPE tables use the `fpe_*` prefix. They are managed exclusively by FPE migrations and never written to by the main application.

| Table | Purpose | Mutable? |
|---|---|---|
| `fpe_wa_messages` | Immutable raw WhatsApp message archive | No (immutable) |
| `fpe_message_processing_state` | Per-message processing FSM | Yes (status updates) |
| `fpe_parser_results` | Parser output per message | No (write-once) |
| `fpe_employees` | FPE employee directory | Yes (name, phone, merge) |
| `fpe_employee_aliases` | Multi-phone/name per employee | Yes (additive only) |
| `fpe_cash_transactions` | Verified transaction ledger | No (immutable; reversal creates new row) |
| `fpe_employee_ledger` | Running totals per employee per month (11 columns — see schema below) | Yes (updated per transaction) |
| `fpe_unmatched_messages` | Parse failures / review queue | Yes (review_status updates) |
| `fpe_accounting_audit_logs` | Immutable accounting audit trail | No |
| `fpe_sync_checkpoints` | Historical sync progress per bridge+JID | Yes |
| `fpe_processing_diagnostics` | Processing latency and outcome per message | Yes |
| `fpe_review_audit_logs` | Admin review actions (promote/dismiss) | No (immutable) |
| `fazle_payment_drafts` | Escort payment drafts created by FPE | Yes (status, approval) |
| `fazle_processing_locks` | Distributed advisory locks | Yes |
| `fazle_bridge_heartbeats` | Per-bridge liveness heartbeats | Yes |
| `fazle_message_queue` | Central inbound message queue | Yes |

### `fpe_employee_ledger` — Column Schema (Wave-4)

**Source:** `modules/fazle_payroll_engine/migrations/001_fpe_schema.sql`
**UNIQUE constraint:** `(employee_id, accounting_period)` — one row per employee per month

| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | BIGSERIAL | NOT NULL | auto | PK |
| `employee_id` | BIGINT | NOT NULL | — | FK → `fpe_employees(id)` |
| `accounting_period` | TEXT | NOT NULL | — | `YYYY-MM` format |
| `opening_balance` | NUMERIC(12,2) | NOT NULL | 0 | Carry-forward from prior period |
| `total_earned` | NUMERIC(12,2) | NOT NULL | 0 | Sum of all earned amounts in period |
| `total_paid` | NUMERIC(12,2) | NOT NULL | 0 | Sum of all paid amounts in period |
| `total_advance` | NUMERIC(12,2) | NOT NULL | 0 | Sum of advance transactions in period |
| `closing_balance` | NUMERIC(12,2) | NOT NULL | 0 | `opening_balance + total_earned - total_paid - total_advance` |
| `txn_count` | INT | NOT NULL | 0 | Number of transactions contributing to period |
| `last_updated` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL | NOW() | Updated on every transaction write |

**Behavior:** Updated by `accounting_worker` on every successful `create_transaction()` call. `closing_balance` represents outstanding balance (positive = owed to employee). Upserted with `ON CONFLICT (employee_id, accounting_period) DO UPDATE`.

---

### `fpe_transaction_repairs` — Re-Attribution Audit Trail (U-02, verified 2026-06-23)

**Source:** Verified via `\d fpe_transaction_repairs` on production DB.
**Purpose:** Immutable audit record of every time a payment transaction is re-attributed from one employee to another (e.g. OCR misread a name, transaction was matched to the wrong employee and later corrected by a repair tool).

| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | BIGSERIAL | NOT NULL | auto | PK |
| `transaction_id` | BIGINT | NOT NULL | — | FK → `fpe_cash_transactions.id` (original txn) |
| `old_employee_id` | BIGINT | — | NULL | Employee the txn was incorrectly attributed to |
| `new_employee_id` | BIGINT | — | NULL | Correct employee after repair |
| `old_employee_name` | TEXT | — | NULL | Snapshot of old name at repair time |
| `new_employee_name` | TEXT | — | NULL | Snapshot of new name at repair time |
| `repair_reason` | TEXT | — | NULL | Human-readable reason for re-attribution |
| `match_method` | TEXT | — | NULL | How the correct employee was found (phone / name / alias / manual) |
| `reversal_txn_id` | BIGINT | — | NULL | FK → `fpe_cash_transactions.id` (counter-transaction created) |
| `new_txn_id` | BIGINT | — | NULL | FK → `fpe_cash_transactions.id` (new corrected transaction) |
| `review_needed` | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL | `false` | Flag for cases that need additional human review |
| `review_note` | TEXT | — | NULL | Note for reviewer |
| `dry_run` | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL | `false` | If true, repair was simulated only (no DB changes) |
| `repaired_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL | NOW() | When repair was executed |
| `repaired_by` | TEXT | NOT NULL | `'repair_tool'` | Actor (repair tool name or admin phone) |

**Relationship to ledger:** A repair creates a reversal transaction (`reversal_txn_id`) on the old employee's account and a new transaction (`new_txn_id`) on the correct employee's account. The `fpe_employee_ledger` is re-computed by the accounting worker after these transactions are inserted. The repair row itself is append-only — never modified after creation.

## Failure Handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Parser returns `confidence < 0.7` | AI enhancement called (Ollama). If AI also fails, stored as `other` type → `skipped`. |
| Parser fails entirely | `store_unmatched(reason='parser_failed')` → `failed` status |
| Employee not found (payment) | `store_unmatched(reason='no_employee_match')` → `failed` status. Money visible in review queue. |
| Employee not found (cash_command) | Error reply sent to source chat via WhatsApp bridge. Row → `skipped`. |
| Accounting exception | `store_unmatched(reason='accounting_failed')` → `failed` status |
| Max attempts reached (5) | Message remains in `failed` state. Surfaced in `/api/fpe/admin/dlq`. |
| Historical sync gap | `gap_scan_loop` rescans by message ID to catch missed messages |
| Bridge health alert | WARNING log + Prometheus gauge. No automatic recovery action. |

---

## Security and Visibility

- All FPE API routes require `X-Internal-Key` header (same as main app)
- `cash_command` and `income_command` require sender phone to be in admin-controlled environment lists (`fpe_cash_authorized_phone_list`, `fpe_income_authorized_phone_list`)
- `fpe_cash_transactions` is immutable — no route allows UPDATE or DELETE on transaction rows
- Reversals create a NEW transaction row (`is_reversal=True`, `reversed_txn_id` FK) — original row preserved
- All admin actions (promote, dismiss) are recorded in `fpe_review_audit_logs` with actor, before_state, after_state
- `fpe_employees` are never hard-deleted — only `status='inactive'` via `/normalization/employees/{id}/inactivate`

## FPE vs Core Payroll — Key Distinction

| | FPE (`fpe_*` tables) | Core Payroll (`wbom_payroll_runs`) |
|---|---|---|
| What it records | Individual transactions parsed from WhatsApp messages | Monthly payroll computation runs |
| Employee source | `fpe_employees` (FPE-specific) | `wbom_employees` (main HR table) |
| State machine | pending→parsing→parsed→accounting→done | draft→reviewed→approved→locked→paid |
| Who triggers | WhatsApp message (automated) | Admin PAYROLL command or daily_payroll_compute job |
| Modification | Immutable — reversals only | Cancellable until paid |
| Audit trail | `fpe_accounting_audit_logs` + `fpe_review_audit_logs` | `wbom_payroll_approval_log` |

---

## Current vs Legacy / Uncertain Behavior

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| All 5 workers | ACTIVE — all started on every platform startup |
| `historical_sync_loop` | ACTIVE — reads production SQLite files; essential for financial completeness |
| `gap_scan_loop` | ACTIVE — runs every 5 minutes; safety net |
| `bridge_health_loop` | ACTIVE — monitoring only; safe to disable without data loss |
| `normalization` routes | ACTIVE — but normalization_reviews workflow not fully documented |
| `escort_payment` → `fazle_payment_drafts` | ACTIVE — links escort duty payments to main platform drafts |
| `BRIDGE1_INGEST_ALL_DMS` env | Documented in code but not yet managed by admin KB |
| `fpe_income_authorized_phone_list` | Known config flag; exact format (comma-separated? env list?) not verified |

---

## Unresolved Questions

| # | Question | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Is `fpe_employees` synchronized with `wbom_employees` in any direction? | Determines whether FPE and core payroll share an employee record |
| 2 | What triggers the `/api/fpe/ingest` endpoint — bridge poller, separate webhook, or both? | Understanding of ingestion flow completeness |
| 3 | What is `fpe_income_authorized_phone_list` populated with? | Authorization boundary for income commands |
| 4 | Does `escort_payment` processing via `fazle_payment_drafts` require a matching escort program, or does it create an orphan draft? | Escorts with no matching program ID get `escort_program_id=NULL` |
| 5 | Are migrations 002–009 all currently applied in production? | Schema completeness cannot be verified without DB access |

## Entity Ownership and Cross-Domain Notes (Wave-2B)

The following clarifications result from the Entity Ownership Audit completed 2026-06-22.

**Entity Ownership Decisions applied:**
- `fazle_payment_drafts` — owned by **CASH/FPE domain** (C-01). Created by escort payment workflow, managed by FPE. See `database_rules.md` Domain 4.
- `fazle_processing_locks` — owned by **SYSTEM domain**. FPE uses it but does not own it. See `database_rules.md` Domain 10.
- `fazle_bridge_heartbeats` — owned by **MESSAGING domain** (C-06). Created by FPE migration but tracks bridge liveness for all consumers.
- `fazle_message_queue` — owned by **MESSAGING domain**. FPE workers consume from it but it is a shared platform resource.

**CASH/FPE table count correction:**
PKMA Report 17 listed 43 tables as undocumented. The Entity Ownership Audit found 21 tables in the CASH/FPE domain specifically (including 17 `fpe_*` prefix tables and 4 shared tables). Total platform tables = 84.

**FPE ↔ HR master soft-link (migration 008):**
`fpe_employees.wbom_employee_id` is a nullable column added by FPE migration 008. It is populated via phone last-10 normalization backfill on service restart. This is NOT an enforced FK — FPE can run without any wbom_employees rows. The link is informational for reconciliation purposes.

**Unresolved Questions — Updated Status:**

| # | Question | Status (Wave-2B) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Is `fpe_employees` synchronized with `wbom_employees`? | Partially resolved: soft-link via `wbom_employee_id` (migration 008). One-way: FPE reads wbom for phone matching. No reverse sync confirmed. |
| 2 | What triggers `/api/fpe/ingest`? | Unresolved — bridge poller or separate webhook not confirmed from KB |
| 3 | `fpe_income_authorized_phone_list` format? | Unresolved — comma-separated env list inferred but not verified |
| 4 | Orphan escort payment draft (no matching program)? | Confirmed: `escort_program_id=NULL` — creates orphan draft; admin must link manually |
| 5 | Migrations 002–009 all applied in production? | Unresolved — requires DB access to verify |
