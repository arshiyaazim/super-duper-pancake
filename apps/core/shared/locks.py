"""
Fazle Core — Shared Processing Lock Helpers
============================================

Provides lightweight distributed-lock semantics backed by the
`fazle_processing_locks` PostgreSQL table (created in migration 008).

Use locks to prevent two workers from processing the same message
or job concurrently.  TTL-based expiry means crashes never leave
locks permanently stuck.

USAGE
-----
    from shared.locks import acquire_lock, release_lock, locked

    # Manual acquire / release:
    ok = await acquire_lock("msg:abc123", worker_id="bridge1", ttl_s=30)
    if ok:
        try:
            ...process...
        finally:
            await release_lock("msg:abc123")

    # Context-manager (preferred):
    async with locked("msg:abc123", worker_id="bridge1", ttl_s=30) as got_lock:
        if not got_lock:
            return  # another worker has it
        ...process...

    # Scheduler cleanup (called every 5 min by scheduler):
    deleted = await cleanup_expired_locks()

SAFETY
------
* All DB operations are idempotent — safe to call repeatedly.
* A lock is acquired only when it does not exist OR has expired.
* TTL defaults to 60 s; callers should set a value that fits their job.
* Uses INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING — no DB exceptions on contention.
