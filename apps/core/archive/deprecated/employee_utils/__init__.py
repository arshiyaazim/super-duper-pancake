Fazle Core — Employee Utilities
Shared helpers for consistent employee identity resolution and auto-creation.

Rules:
  - Phone is the single source of truth for identity
  - normalize_phone() MUST be called before any DB lookup or insert
  - ON CONFLICT (employee_mobile) DO UPDATE keeps the canonical DB name
    (never overwrites with incoming message name)
